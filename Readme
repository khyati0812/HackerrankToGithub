ðŸš€ Chrome Extension for Automated Code Push from HackerRank to GitHub
Overview
This Chrome Extension automates the process of pushing solutions from HackerRank directly to your GitHub repository. After solving a challenge on HackerRank, the extension extracts key details such as the problem title, programming language, and difficulty level (currently hardcoded) and organizes the code into appropriate folders in your repository.

Features
Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light modes for a better user experience.
GitHub Authentication: Securely authenticate your GitHub account through the extension.
Repository Management: Link, create, or unlink repositories directly within the extension.
Automated Code Push: Automatically pushes code to GitHub upon successful submission on HackerRank.
Organized Structure: Solutions are categorized by difficulty level and programming language in your GitHub repository.

How It Works
Authenticate GitHub Account: On installing the extension, authenticate your GitHub account.
Link GitHub Repository: Choose an existing repository or create a new one directly from the extension. You can unlink it any time.
Solve a Problem: Navigate to HackerRank, solve a challenge, and upon submission, the extension pushes the solution to GitHub.
Automatic Categorization: Solutions are organized into folders by difficulty and programming language.

Challenges Faced
GitHub Authentication: Managing GitHub tokens was complex, especially dealing with "access tokens" and "refresh tokens." Upon returning to HackerRank, the token was often lost.
Solution: Implemented session storage to temporarily store access tokens, with improved error handling.
Chrome Context Invalidated: Switching between HackerRank and the extension caused Chrome's context to invalidate, preventing the code push.
Solution: Improved the message-passing mechanism and background script persistence to maintain the active context.
Difficulty Level Extraction: HackerRank doesnâ€™t display difficulty levels on the coding page.
Solution: Plan to automate difficulty extraction via API calls or background scripts in the future.
Element Identification: Identifying elements like problem title, language, and confirmation message was tricky due to DOM changes.
Solution: Used efficient class selectors and mutation observers to dynamically capture these elements.

Future Enhancements
Dynamic Difficulty Extraction: Automate difficulty level extraction to eliminate hardcoded values.
Problem Statistics: Track and display solved problem counts for different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
Chrome Web Store Launch: Plan to launch the extension on the Chrome Web Store.
UI Improvements: Enhance the UI with HackerRank logos and a more intuitive interface.
Error Handling: Improve error handling for cases when variables load late or fail to load.
